    "didYouKnow": "Studies using MDMA (Ecstasy), which affects serotonin levels, have shown that serotonin plays a role in 'sharpening' how your brain interprets visual orientations. When serotonin levels are altered, it can affect the brain's ability to filter out visual information, leading to changes in perceived visual illusions like the 'Tilt Aftereffect'.",
