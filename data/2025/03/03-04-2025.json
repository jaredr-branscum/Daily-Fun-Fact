    "didYouKnow": "Cesare Cardini, an Italian immigrant living in the US and Mexico, is credited with inventing the Caesar salad at his restaurant in Tijuana back in July 4, 1924. The original recipe consisted of only seven ingredients: romaine lettuce, raw egg yolk, olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, and a toasted baguette slice. The popular additions like garlic, anchovies, and croutons came later. His brother also claimed to have invented the salad, sparking a debate about the true inventor.",
